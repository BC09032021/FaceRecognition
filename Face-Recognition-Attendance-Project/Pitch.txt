

 step-1:Finding all the Faces (Camera ex and it uses Haar cascade classifiers (Viola-Jones detectors))
what is HOG:
The Histogram of Oriented Gradients method suggested by Dalal and Triggs in their seminal 2005 paper,(For reference)

 Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG) image descriptor and a Linear Support Vector Machine (SVM) 
could be used to train highly accurate object classifiers 

Our goal is to figure out how dark the current pixel is compared to the pixels directly surrounding it.
 Then we want to draw an arrow showing in which direction the image is getting darker
:(These arrows are called gradiants)

we will finally end up with all the pixels replaced with gradiants

why to replace with gradiants?

If we compare pixels directly there will be huge difference b/w the pixel vlaues of a 
same person in his light and dark 
images so to take the brightness of the image out of equation we will look into gradiants.

Step-2: Posing and Projecting Faces 
Point-1)
After the detection of  face in an image now we need to tackle the problem of differently oriented faces in different
directions.

Step 3: Encoding Faces
